# PCST - PythonCheckSumTool for Windows
English:

Simple, convenient and portable (no installation required) checksum tool written in Python.

To start using PCST, download the source code (PCST.py), install colorama and pyperclip libraries and run it in any way convenient for you, or download the binary EXE file PCST.exe (weighs more) if Python 3 is not installed on your computer.

To use PCST, you just need to start it and follow simple steps. There are no flags or parameters.

PCST uses the GPLv3 free license.
